Write A Python Program To Calculate Symmetric Difference Of Two Set

# What is a symmetric difference?
#  the symmetric difference of two sets refers to the elements that belong to either of the two sets but not to both simultaneously.
# means (set1 - set2) and (set2 - set1)  or (A △ B) = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)


# a = {12,2,0,3,8} 

# b = {15,10,12,3,6}

# # c = (a.union(b)).difference(a.intersection(b))

# c = a.symmetric_difference(b)

# print(c)
